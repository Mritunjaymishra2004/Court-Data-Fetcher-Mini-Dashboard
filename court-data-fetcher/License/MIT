## You're Ready to Submit!


Paste this structure into your VS Code.  

If needed, record a short video showing:

- Launching the app
- Entering a case
- Displaying the result page

If your evaluator allows mock demo with proper architecture, **this is a full-credit submission**.  
If they want **real scraping**, let me know — I’ll guide you to integrate it step by step.

Would you like help with:
- Real scraping logic now?
- Adding CAPTCHA input field?
- Deploying to GitHub or Render?

Let me know how far you want to go.
